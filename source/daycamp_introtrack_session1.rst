Trying Linux on a Virtual Machine
---------------------------------

Virtual machines act as a full system on a physical machine

.. figure:: /static/virtualbox.png

    :scale: 50%

* Hypervisors:
    * VirtualBox (free)
    * VMWare (mostly free)
    * KVM (Linux only hosts)
    * Parallels
* Public Cloud Virtual Machines
    * Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud, Google Compute Engine, etc
* Easy way to test without breaking your machine!

Installing Linux on Virtualbox
------------------------------

.. note:: 
  Try other distributions if you like to see what's different. Debian is a great
  next step to try out.

#. Download and install: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
#. Grab the latest minimal ISO: http://centos.osuosl.org/6/isos/x86_64/
#. Create VM
    #. New -> Name "CentOS" -> Default Ram -> Default Disk settings
    #. Settings -> Storage -> Empty -> CD/DVD Drive -> Select ISO
    #. Start -> press enter -> Skip media check
#. ``\o/``

Vagrant & VirtualBox
--------------------

.. note::
  We're using CentOS as our base image for now but will use Debian later. You
  can see the gui by uncommenting the line in the Vagrantfile.

* Vagrant is a tool used with Virtualbox (and other) platforms
* Make a reproducible pre-installed Linux environment
* Download and install: http://www.vagrantup.com/
* Clone our repo, start and access the vm:

.. code-block:: bash

    # clone
    git clone https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/devopsbootcamp-vagrant.git

    # start up
    cd devopsbootcamp-vagrant
    vagrant up

    # access vm
    vagrant ssh

Vagrant cheat sheet
-------------------

.. note::
  We'll get into more detail later in how you can access ports on your VMs and
  other use cases.

.. code-block:: bash

    # start
    vagrant up

    # stop
    vagrant halt

    # destroy (remove vm)
    vagrant destroy

    # ssh to the vm
    vagrant ssh

Also check out the `Vagrant Documentation
<http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html>`_ for more information.
